	KNOT hal for systems

KNOT hal is part of KNOT project. It aims to provide a driver service
for KNOT client modules, allowing power constrained embedded device to
interact with KONT services.

The initial target platform are nRF24L01 nodes. nRF24L01 is a highly integrated,
ultra low power (ULP) 2Mbps RF transceiver IC for the 2.4GHz ISM band. On a second
project phase, other radio access technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy, and
Wi-Fi are planned.
